# GitHub Pull Request (PR) Guidelines

Welcome to our project repository! This README outlines our conventions and procedures for using Pull Requests (PRs) on GitHub. Adhering to these guidelines ensures that our codebase remains clean, efficient, and error-free.

## Introduction to Pull Requests

Pull Requests are a vital tool for collaboration in team projects. They allow multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously without interfering with the main codebase. PRs also facilitate thorough code reviews and discussions before changes are integrated.

## Branching Strategy

- **Main Branch**: This is the production branch and should always be deployable.
- **Development Branch**: This is the primary branch for development, where feature branches merge before being moved to the main branch.
- **Feature Branches**: Branch off from `development` for each new feature. Use a clear and descriptive name prefixed with your initials, e.g., `js-add-login-feature`.

## Creating a Pull Request

1. **Check Out a New Branch**: From the `development` branch, create a new branch for your feature.
2. **Develop Your Feature**: Implement your feature and commit your changes. Keep your commits small and focused with descriptive messages.
3. **Sync Frequently**: Regularly pull updates from the `development` branch into your feature branch to stay up-to-date.
4. **Push Your Branch**: Push your feature branch to GitHub.
5. **Open a PR**: From GitHub, open a new Pull Request to merge your feature branch into `development`. Title your PR clearly and link to any relevant issues.

## Writing a Good Pull Request Description

Your PR description should include:
- A summary of the changes, why they are necessary, and any related issue numbers.
- Any specific instructions or considerations for reviewers.
- Screenshots or GIFs of UI changes, if applicable.

## PR Review and Collaboration

- **Code Reviews**: At least one team member must review the PR. Reviewers should look for code quality, functionality, and alignment with project standards.
- **Discuss and Refine**: Use PR discussion threads to ask questions, suggest changes, and refine the code.
- **Approval and Merge**: Once the PR is approved by the required number of reviewers, it can be merged into `development`.
- **Delete the Branch**: After merging, delete the feature branch to keep the repository clean.

## Additional Conventions

- **Testing**: Include tests with your PRs to maintain and improve code quality.
- **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect any changes or additions made.
- **Avoid Large PRs**: Aim to keep PRs small and focused. If a feature is large, break it into smaller, manageable parts.

## Handling Conflicts

If your PR has conflicts with the target branch, resolve them by merging the target branch into your feature branch and handling the differences. Never push directly to `development` or `main`.

## Security Considerations

Do not commit sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) into the repository. Use environment variables and ensure `.env` files are in `.gitignore`.

By following these guidelines, we can maintain a smooth, efficient, and productive development process. Happy coding!
