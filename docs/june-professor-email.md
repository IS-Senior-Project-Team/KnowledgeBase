# Welcome to Senior Project Class – June Month Tasks

## Hello Class,

Welcome to the IS Senior Project Capstone course. In this course, you will be learning about software development processes, methods, and various software engineering techniques. This course follows the learning-by-doing philosophy. Therefore, you will be working on a real-world project impacting community partners in Florida. I will share a project description package during the first week of August.

### Action Item: Submit Team Name and Members Info by July 7th

With this email, I am requesting you form a four-person team. In Canvas, you can use the People course menu option to see the listing of enrolled students. If you are not part of a team, contact other students you may know to form a team or join an existing one. I have created a discussion forum in Canvas to assist with holding team search discussions. After you form a team, email me the requested information. Remember to carbon copy (CC) your team members in the email. Each team must have four members, nothing more or less. I will update the webpage below as I receive information on student teams.

**Note:** All team members should have completed a course relevant to the selected programming platform. If your team is selecting ASP.NET Core, then all team members should have completed COP 3855 – Web Systems Development. If your team selects JavaScript as the programming platform, team members should have taken either COP 3813 – Internet Programming or COP 4854 – Web Frameworks for ASP.NET Core.

Email k.umapathy@unf.edu the following info on or before July 7th:
- Team name
- Preferred development platform (Pick one of the following: ASP.NET Core or JavaScript)
- Team member 1 name, N-number, and course completed relevant to the selected platform
- Team member 2 name, N-number, and course completed relevant to the selected platform
- Team member 3 name, N-number, and course completed relevant to the selected platform
- Team member 4 name, N-number, and course completed relevant to the selected platform

### Action Item: Complete Background Info and Summer Plans Form by July 5th

### Web Application Development Platforms

As a team, you can use ASP.NET Core or JavaScript frameworks to develop your web application in the senior project class. Regardless of the platform, the model-view-controller (MVC) will be the primary architecture pattern for developing the application. You will learn about the software lifecycle development processes in the course. Web application programming skillsets are a prerequisite for the course. Therefore, the course will cover other aspects of developing software, assuming that students have the required programming prerequisite skills. Thus, it is crucial to use the remaining summer weeks to expand your web application programming skills. In the upcoming weeks, you will receive a pre-semester teamwork assignment, which can guide you in working as a team to improve your programming skills.

### Practicing Web Application Programming Skills

I have listed self-learning resources for ASP.NET Core and JavaScript frameworks in Canvas. Please refer to the Senior Project Self-Learning Programming Resources module.

### Project & Mentor Selections

After receiving the project package in the first week of August, each team would be asked to submit their top three project and mentor choices. The project and mentor will be assigned on a first-come and first-serve basis. Note that you must be part of a team to submit project & mentor assignment requests. Project selection must be completed on or before August 15th.

### Upcoming Action Items That Need to Be Performed Before the Semester Starts
- **Project and mentor selections by August 16th:** More information will be shared.
- **Pre-semester assignment:** This deliverable is a teamwork assignment. More information on this assignment will be provided later. This assignment will be due on the first day of the fall semester.
- **Deliverable 0 assignment:** This deliverable is an individual work assignment. More information on this assignment will be provided later. This assignment will be due one week after the fall semester starts.

I am looking forward to working with you and learning with all of you.

Regards,

Karthik
