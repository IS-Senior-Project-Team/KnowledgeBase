### Service Learning
CIS 4327 is a Community-Based Transformational Learning (CBTL) course. This class utilizes service-learning based instruction in which students will achieve course objectives through community-based projects. Throughout this course, students will have adequate opportunity to interact with community partners and reflect on their learning and service. As a part of this course, students will offer information systems development service to non-profit and small-business organizations from Northeast Florida region. Students will work as a part of a team to develop a prototype software product that addresses a real-world problem faced by a community partner. For more information on CBTL, refer to [http://www.unf.edu/ccbl/What_is_Community-Based_Transformational_Learning_(CBTL)_.aspx](http://www.unf.edu/ccbl/What_is_Community-Based_Transformational_Learning_(CBTL)_.aspx).

In this course, students will learn software engineering techniques and software development lifecycle processes, which include requirements elicitation, analysis & design, implementation, and testing. Students will apply skills gained in the classroom to develop prototypical software that addresses a need of a community partner. Software product requirements tend to be unspecified or poorly specified at the beginning. In the first semester, students are expected to work along with community partners to document software requirements. Students will analyze the requirement specifications and design the software. The major outcome for the first semester would be a beta-level implementation of the software product. In the second semester, students will produce a detailed design for the product, implement the all stated requirements, test the product, and deliver the product to the community partner. Students are expected to train community partner to use the product. The major outcome for the second semester is delivering a product that is useful and produces intended impact for the community partner.

### Instructor Responsibilities
- Provide an environment that allows students to gain practical experience and acquire an ethic of community service.
- Provide curricular-based service opportunities relevant to course learning objectives, class schedules, and student capabilities.
- Provide guidance and supervise student service-learning activities.
- Work towards resolving concerns and issues with service-learning activities.
- Provide students with learning materials and in-class activities that will enable them to perform service-learning activities.
- Evaluate student service-learning activities based on feedback received from community partners.

### Student Responsibilities
- Students are expected to work at a minimum of 10 hours per week towards the project.
- Students are expected to work collaboratively as a team. Students are expected to work face-to-face and asynchronously on shared tasks regularly.
- Maintain regular communication with the community partner, mentor, and instructor.
- Help community partners understand technological software capability relevant to their problem
- Regularly attend the class, team meetings, weekly and monthly sprint review meetings, community partner meetings, and meetings with a mentor.
- Work towards understanding community partner needs and develop a software product that addresses their problem.
- Work along with a mentor to learn and incorporate industry best practices for developing a quality software product.

### Community Partner Responsibilities
- Encourage and support the student’s learning and educational experience in aspects of the project work.
- Assign a point of a contact person to answer student questions and provide clarification.
- Agree with the outcome of the student service-learning activities will be a prototypical product.
- Participate in problem definition, requirements elicitation, design reviews, prototype reviews, product demonstrations, presentations, and other relevant activities.

- Monitor progress of student work, and report progress and performance to faculty
- Work with faculty to obtain a satisfactory resolution to any issues that may occur during the project work. If a satisfactory resolution is not reached, then Community Partner may request the instructor for termination from participation in the senior project class.

### Mentor Responsibilities
- Meet with students at minimum once a month.
- Maintain regular communication with students using an appropriate medium.
- Maintain regular communication with the instructor in regard to student interactions and project progress.
- Monitor students’ progress on their project tasks.

Please read the service-learning community partnership memo in the service-learning module in the Canvas. This memo was shared with community partners. The memo outlines student and community partner responsibilities. Memo informs community partners regarding intellectual property rights and confidentiality of information shared.

### Community Partners and Project Details
Below you can find a list of projects, community partners, and summary of the project descriptions. Please see community partner project details document in the service-learning module in Canvas for complete project description provided by community partners. Each team will have an assigned mentor from local software companies, who will provide you guidance in solving technical problems and navigating perils of real-world projects.

#### Project 1: Classroom Connection System
**Community Partner:** Friends of Dinsmore Elementary, Inc.  
**Industry Mentor:** Yet to be announced

Friends of Dinsmore Elementary believe investing extra effort and resources on our Title One public school students will last a lifetime. Friends of Dinsmore Elementary would like the ability to display the website all the elementary classroom group photos dating back to 1953. The web application system should list each photo in the database by school year, grade, and teacher. School alumni can have fun viewing old classroom photos and labeling the persons in the photos. Contact information and other tidbits could be added for each person. Once all persons are identified in a photo, the photo would receive an attendance award. For further discussion, everyone can link to the classroom’s blog page. In addition to being fun and promoting school pride, Classroom Connection will draw a lot of traffic to our website. More people will then learn about volunteer opportunities, how donations are used, and school events.

#### Project 2: Inventory Management System
**Community Partner:** Epic Cure, Inc.  
**Industry Mentor:** Yet to be announced

Epic Cure Inc. is a 100% volunteer organization founded in 2018 in response to the staggering amount of food waste in our country. Epic Cure’s mission is to take urgent, immediate, and continuous action to make a measurable difference in eliminating food waste and ending hunger. Epic Cure is currently building out a 2nd warehouse in Putnam County, the 4th poorest county in Florida. With that 15,000 sqft facility, Epic Cure can expand food rescue and distribution as well as be a support hub to all other food pantries and soup kitchens in the surrounding counties with our storage capacity for both refrigerated and dry goods. Epic Cure anticipates increasing “pounds in” distribution to over 1,000,000 per month in the first year. To accomplish that and be a support hub, Epic Cure needs an inventory and order system for the other agencies to see products available in real-time so they can place orders. This project will make Epic Cure more efficient, accurate and allows to focus current funds on helping more people.

#### Project 3: Training and Resource Management System
**Community Partner:** Center for Children’s Rights  
**Industry Mentor:** Yet to be announced

The Center for Children’s Rights’ (CCR) mission is to advance the rights of children through legal advocacy, policy and practice transformation, and restorative justice. CCR website maintains
