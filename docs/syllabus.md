Service Learning
CIS 4327 is a Community-Based Transformational
Learning (CBTL) course. This class utilizes service-
learning based instruction in which students will
achieve course objectives through community-
based projects. Throughout this course, students
will have adequate opportunity to interact with
community partners and reflect on their learning
and service. As a part of this course, students will
offer information systems development service to non-profit and small-business organizations from
Northeast Florida region. Students will work as a part of a team to develop a prototype software product
that addresses a real-world problem faced by a community partner. For more information on CBTL, refer
to http://www.unf.edu/ccbl/What_is_Community-Based_Transformational_Learning_(CBTL)_.aspx.
In this course, students will learn software engineering techniques and software development lifecycle
processes, which include requirements elicitation, analysis & design, implementation, and testing.
Students will apply skills gained in the classroom to develop prototypical software that addresses a need
of a community partner. Software product requirements tend to be unspecified or poorly specified at the
beginning. In the first semester, students are expected to work along with community partners to
4
document software requirements. Students will analyze the requirement specifications and design the
software. The major outcome for the first semester would be a beta-level implementation of the software
product. In the second semester, students will produce a detailed design for the product, implement the
all stated requirements, test the product, and deliver the product to the community partner. Students
are expected to train community partner to use the product. The major outcome for the second semester
is delivering a product that is useful and produces intended impact for the community partner.

Community Partners and Project Details
Below you can find a list of projects, community partners, and summary of the project descriptions.
Please see community partner project details document in the service-learning module in Canvas for
complete project description provided by community partners. Each team will have an assigned mentor
from local software companies, who will provide you guidance in solving technical problems and
navigating perils of real-world projects.
Project 1: Classroom Connection System
Community Partner: Friends of Dinsmore Elementary, Inc.
Industry Mentor: Yet to be announced
Friends of Dinsmore Elementary believe investing extra effort and resources on our Title One public
school students will last a lifetime. Friends of Dinsmore Elementary would like the ability to display the
website all the elementary classroom group photos dating back to 1953. The web application system
6
should list each photo in the database by school year, grade, and teacher. School alumni can have fun
viewing old classroom photos and labeling the persons in the photos. Contact information and other
tidbits could be added for each person. Once all persons are identified in a photo, the photo would receive
an attendance award. For further discussion, everyone can link to the classroom’s blog page. In addition
to being fun and promoting school pride, Classroom Connection will draw a lot of traffic to our website.
More people will then learn about volunteer opportunities, how donations are used, and school events.
Project 2: Inventory Management System
Community Partner: Epic Cure, Inc.
Industry Mentor: Yet to be announced
Epic Cure Inc. is a 100% volunteer organization founded in 2018 in response to the staggering amount of
food waste in our country. Epic Cure’s mission is to take urgent, immediate, and continuous action to
make a measurable difference in eliminating food waste and ending hunger. Epic Cure is currently
building out a 2nd warehouse in Putnam County, the 4th poorest county in Florida. With that 15,000 sqft
facility, Epic Cure can expand food rescue and distribution as well as be a support hub to all other food
pantries and soup kitchens in the surrounding counties with our storage capacity for both refrigerated
and dry goods. Epic Cure anticipates increasing “pounds in” distribution to over 1,000,000 per month in
the first year. To accomplish that and be a support hub, Epic Cure needs an inventory and order system
for the other agencies to see products available in real-time so they can place orders. This project will
make Epic Cure more efficient, accurate and allows to focus current funds on helping more people.
Project 3: Training and Resource Management System
Community Partner: Center for Children’s Rights
Industry Mentor: Yet to be announced
The Center for Children’s Rights’ (CCR) mission is to advance the rights of children through legal advocacy,
policy and practice transformation, and restorative justice. CCR website maintains training and resources
for juvenile justice attorneys, advocates, and stakeholders. Through the website, users can access these
free resources. However, the current website configuration is not optimal for the user or for CCR to
manage. To extend CCR reach and the ease for others to access, CCR want to build a system to categorize
training and resources such that they are easily accessible. CCR also hope to make available relevant
information and forms for children and their families to access in a “self-help” fashion. CCR is positioned
to become the primary organization for the dissemination of juvenile justice-related materials, but to do
so, CCR needs a website that both our users and CCR staffs can easily use. This project will advance CCRs
mission to transform the juvenile justice system locally and statewide by making important information
about the juvenile justice system, advocating for children, trauma and developmentally informed
practices widely available.
7
Project 4: Check-in Check-out System
Community Partner: The Arc Jacksonville On Campus Transition (OCT)
Industry Mentor: Yet to be announced
OCT students follow a unique and customized plan for achievement, rather than a structured curriculum.
The Arc Jacksonville’s OCT serves persons ages 18-26, who have completed four years of high school.
OCT students become immersed in all aspects of college life by: auditing UNF courses, joining campus
organizations and clubs, and joining in recreational/leisure activities that are available to all UNF students.
OCT students also can live in either on or off-campus student housing, and they receive small group
tutoring and mentoring by UNF students. With OCT program, students check-in/check-out every day at
certain times in the office. Current system has check in feature but does not check out. With this project,
OCT wants an easy way for students to add their information into a site to check in, while also on the
back-end OCT staff can see certain information about the student. This would include their funding
sources (required for certain scholarships within our program), if they were tardy, did not attend
programs. The project would help with OCT staff spending less time organizing this information for the
Department of Education and focus on other facets of the program. It would also be beneficial for
students to hold them more accountable and that they are checking in and out and attending events.
Project 5: Surplus Deficit Automation System
Community Partner: Northeast Florida Area Agency on Aging dba ElderSource
Industry Mentor: Yet to be announced
ElderSource, the Area Agency on Aging (AAA) and Aging and Disability Resource Center (ADRC) for
Northeast Florida administers federal, state and local funds for programs for seniors and their caregivers.
ElderSource is responsible for the stewardship of funds distributed to Providers within a seven-county
area. The Surplus Deficit tool provides an overview of where funds are being spent to support older adults
remaining in their homes and minimizing the occurrence of premature nursing home placement.
Currently, the Surplus Deficit is a manual process in which formulas are added each month to an excel
spreadsheet. In addition to formulas, static items such as Contract Amount are gathered from individual
surplus deficit forms submitted from Providers. The process takes approximately 40 hours to complete
using this manual process and must be done every month. The Surplus Deficit automation process would
transition the data entry of the report to have one interface that can be used by both ElderSource and
the Providers. The Providers would visit the interface monthly and submit the requested information.
The formulas would be held in the database and would automatically update additional fields based on
submissions. ElderSource and the Providers would have access to pull completed surplus deficit reports
from the database each month. By monitoring the spending of State and Federal programs in each of the
counties, ElderSource can easily identify where there is a need. The time the current report is taking
impacts the workload of three ElderSource staff, limiting the time that they are available to focus on
identifying areas of unmet need, assisting Providers with programmatic, technical assistance to ensure
that they can provide quality services to seniors.

Project 6: County Impact Data Dashboard
Community Partner: American Red Cross (ARC), Northeast Florida Region
Industry Mentor: Yet to be announced
The American Red Cross prevents and alleviates human suffering in the face of emergencies by
mobilizing the power of volunteers and the generosity of donors. North Florida American Red Cross
maintains a wide variety of crucial information regarding each county served in Excel files. Each county
has a separate Excel with individual sheets for a different set of items recorded. Items recorded include
partnerships, readiness, shelter plan, relationships, preparedness, Disaster Action Team (DAT), Disaster
Workforce Engagement (DWE), non-responders, responders, DAT Training, Fire Depts, 911 centers, DAT
success stories, and HFC Follow Up. ARC would like to manage this information using a web-based
application system. ARC wants to develop data entry web forms for each current spreadsheet
header/information type, which can ensure data is documented consistently. While predominant of the
headers relevant to information items are consistent, there is unique information for certain counties;
the data entry forms must handle those discrepancies. ARC would also like to be able to create a report
generation feature to extract county wise data from the database. This project would improve the
organization’s ability to maintain current data and shared widely between 1000+ consumers. During
disaster response, having this information on hand is invaluable for incoming responders, not from our
Region, to communicate with local officials and share relevant up to date information.
Project 7: Family Case Management and Partnership Coordination Tool
Community Partner: V for Victory
Industry Mentor: Yet to be announced
V for Victory cultivates and builds relationships with local businesses to provide resources and services,
at no cost, to local families and individuals who are battling cancer. V for Victory is seeking a web
application system to manage family demographic, and services received information, as well as track
progress through a requested service being completed. Simultaneously it would also be able to store
business partnership information (including types of service, service area, contact information, etc.).
Ideally, these two information banks would be searchable and able to “talk” to each other. For example,
when a family requests help with an auto repair, V for Victory staff could search for a partnering mechanic
in our database, connect that account with the family in need, track progress of that service being
completed, and payments made by V for Victory for that service on behalf of the family. This
management and coordination system would be an incredible value resource for V for Victory to expand
business partnerships and increase capacity to serve families in Northeast Florida battling cancer.
Project 8: Impact Data for the Taking it to the Streets for Life Program
Community Partner: SisterHermana Foundation
Industry Mentor: Yet to be announced
9
The SisterHermana Foundation, Inc is an organization of volunteers with a grand mission to inform the
community about cancer, educate about its prevention, and support those in active cancer treatment. In
Duval County, the Age-adjusted rate for cancer deaths per 100,000 people is 170, whereas the State of
Florida is 155 deaths per 100.000 people. Duval County’s cancer death rate is higher than the entire state
of Florida. Problems identified are limited knowledge of the signs and symptoms of curable cancers, lack
of access to care, and those who are uninsured or underinsured not being familiar with resources for
screening available - resulting in a late diagnosis of cancer when the prognosis is poor. The purpose of
our Taking it to the Streets for Life program is to reduce significantly late diagnosis by going door to door
to provide information about cancer, its signs and symptoms resources for services in the most impacted
underserved and uninsured communities. SisterHermana is seeking a web application system to collect
and manage data relevant to the Taking it to the Streets for Life program. The project will allow
SisterHermana to prove the value of our services to potential funders while developing best practices for
data collection. As well as, expanding our reach to serve more communities.
Project 9: Donor and Volunteer Management System
Community Partner: The Giving Closet Project, Inc.
Industry Mentor: Yet to be announced
The Giving Closet Project (GCP), Inc. provides clothing and hygiene products to students in need,
elevating their self-esteem and dignity. Donor relations and stewardship are a top priority for nonprofits.
However, GCP currently do not have a donor management system built. Tracking the different types of
money that comes into the organization is especially important. Whether it is Facebook, individuals,
family foundations, corporations, in-kind, or awarded grants, it all needs tracked. This system should give
us information on the percentages of where funding comes from, where to improve efforts for bringing
in funds, to get notifications of when grants are due and thanking donors a streamlined, automated
process. Creating an engaging volunteer platform to ensure the community knows of volunteer projects
and upcoming events, interest surveys to find out how individuals would like to get involved, tracking of
volunteer information, hours served, and incentives once volunteers reach a certain amount of hours.
Becoming a volunteer should be an easy task, and GCP want to create an automated system to keep
volunteers in the know of how they can give back to students in need, virtually or in person. This software
will allow GCP to better these relationships in a way that is much more time-efficient, organized, and
effective. The data produced by this software will also be valuable when writing grants.
Project 10: Client Admin Portal for Legal Document Preparation
Community Partner: Robert W. Schupp, P.A.
Industry Mentor: Yet to be announced
Robert W. Schupp is an attorney specializing in Landlord/Tenant Law. Robert would like online client
portal to handle new client registrations. Once the clients are registered, their login will lay the
groundwork for all future communication with these clients and property managers. Accuracy, efficiency,
and ease of use by the client are the keys to all services we provide. The main function of this web
10
application is to automate the preparation of legal documents. The clients will need to be able to submit
between 50 and 75 fields of information. The system needs to initiate some validation checks of the data
automatically and then, if appropriate, produce an MS Word document to be reviewed by Robert. Then,
a process needs to be in place for Robert to create a .pdf from the MS Word document and email it back
to the client. Otherwise, Robert will need to receive an error message containing a summary of the data
and the corresponding error. Client logs and progress reports will also be required. The current process
of gathering relevant information from the client and generating MS Word documents is tedious. This
online portal will help Robert with providing core business services to our clients efficiently and effectively.

Project Deliverable 1 (Due: September 30)
Project Vision
The Product Vision artifact defines the stakeholder’s view of the product to be developed, specified in
terms of the stakeholder’s key needs and features.
Product Backlog
The Product Backlog is a prioritized list of all functionality identified for implementation. The Product
backlog would primarily contain user stories along with other software development tasks. The product
backlog should be maintained via JIRA system.
User Stories
A user story is a brief statement of a feature that describes something the system needs to do from the
user perspective. User stories should be maintained via JIRA system.
Sprint Backlog
The sprint backlog is the list of tasks (drawn from the Product Backlog and other software development
tasks) that the team will complete in the current and the next iterations. Sprint backlog should be
maintained via JIRA system.
Initial Software Development Plan
Good project planning is critical to the success of any software development effort. The software
development plan should be driven based prioritized product backlog and the overall features and
functionality that the product will contain. The goal of the initial software development plan is to provide
a rough estimate of which features will be delivered on a sprint-by-sprint basis.
First Iteration Product Release
Each team member demonstrates their expertise to work on the project using the selected programming
platform by developing initial implementation for high priority functionalities. Each member must select
different functionalities to demonstrate their capabilities.
Project Deliverable 2 (Due: October 28)
Outline Use Case
Outline use cases are developed in the first phase of the requirements lifecycle of use cases. The purpose
is to create an outline for use case specification, containing following details: name, short description,
use case diagram, basic flow (name of each step), alternative flows (name of each identified flow), and
scenarios (name of each identified scenario along with names of basic and alternative flows).
15
Detail Use Case
Complete use case specifications contain detailed basic flows, alternative flows, sub-flows, key scenarios,
pre-conditions, post-conditions, special requirements, and other additional requirements.
User Interface Mockups
User interface requirements can be documented using wireframes. Wireframes are a pictorial
representation of the user interface of the system. Wireframes can be used to capture requirements on
how the system interface should be laid out so that the user can accomplish their goals. Create
wireframes for the use case specifications you are working as a part of this deliverable.
Second Iteration Product Release (working interface prototype and initial attempt on high
risk/priority features development)
Develop an exploratory prototype to demonstrate something concrete and executable for functionalities
that present a challenge to your team due to a lack of technical know-how to build the software or due
to the associated risk.
Also, include an updated software development plan. Remember to update user stories (product
backlog) and sprint backlog maintained in JIRA.
Project Deliverable 3 (Due: December 2)
Activity Diagrams
An activity diagram in the use-case model illustrates the flow of events of a use case. The flow of events
of a use case describes what needs to be done by the system to provide value to an actor.
Analysis Diagrams
The analysis model contains analysis classes (boundary, control, and entity) and relationships among
them. The analysis model represents an early conceptual design model of the system. Analysis classes
capture the major “clumps of responsibility” in the system.
Sequence Diagrams
A sequence diagram describes a pattern of interaction among objects, arranged in chronological order;
it shows the objects participating in the interaction by their “lifelines” and the messages that they send
to each other.
Preliminary Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram
Database is core to the Web application systems. It is critical to design a preliminary database as a part
of the analysis process. Create an entity-relationship (ER) diagram depicting the information that is
created, stored, and used by your application system.
16
Third Iteration Product Release
Develop a working prototype for identified use cases.
Also, include an updated software development plan and use case artifacts. Remember to update user
stories (product backlog) and sprint backlog maintained in JIRA.
Quizzes (Individual Activity, Due: Random Days)
There will be a total of 5 quizzes; each explores a specific sub-topic covered in the class. Each quiz will be
worth one grade point. You will be provided with two attempts to complete the quiz. The final attempt
score will be used towards grade calculation. You will need to be present in the class on the day when the
quiz is released.
Viable Product Prototype (Individual Activity, Due: December 7)
By the end of the semester, the viable product prototype must be deployed in the resources provided by
the community partner. It should be hosted and running at the partner provided environment and
infrastructure. A viable product has a core set of features that allow the product to be deployed in the
client environment and offers meaningful value to the client. A viable product is not a minimum product
or effort, but a product that has sufficient functionality to validate your learning, solution, and direction
of the project. Ultimately, you are learning how to be a computing professional in this class. A
professional is judged on the quality of service provided to the client. Thus, product deployment and
delivery are of utmost importance. It is critical that software product is deployed and it should not contain
any significant usability issues.
Biweekly Project Progress Reports (Due every two weeks)
Students are expected to report their project progress on a biweekly basis as a formal report document
to the instructor, industry mentor, and community partner. The project progress report should provide a
list of tasks performed; whether the task performed is complete or incomplete, tasks are you planning to
work on for next and forthcoming weeks, problems or other issues that affect project progress, and
information (or action items) needed from mentors and partners.
Weekly Verbal Sprint Review Report (Individual Activity, Due every Wednesday)
During every Wednesday class, student teams are expected to conduct a weekly sprint review meeting
to reflect on their service-learning work and project progress. In collaborative software development,
team members spend a considerable amount of time seeking information sources to help with their
software development tasks. Students are expected to report the project status and knowledge gained
from software development by answering the following questions:
• What have you done in the past week? List of tasks performed and whether it complete or incomplete.
• What tasks are you planning to work on for next week?
17
• Do you have any problems preventing you from accomplishing your tasks? Lack of skill set, lack of
direction, team communication issues, community partner issues, software development, etc.
• Describe the solution adopted to solve the problem. What information sources did you use to search
for solutions to your problems?
• Did you interact with the community partner? Describe your interaction with the partner.
• Do you have any useful information to may be relevant to your team member’s task or help improve
their performance?
Each student is responsible for reporting their project progress directly to the instructor. Students can
report the progress made in the class on Thursday or can meet with the instructor separately to report
them. Please note that this will be a verbal report of the project progress made every week, and this is
different from the team’s bi-weekly report. This weekly verbal report from each student will help me to
know of problems/issues faced by the team earlier on and not a week later. It should be noted that the
weekly verbal sprint report is a part of your regular class participation and attendance grade.
School of Computing Symposium
CIS 4327 students will present results of their project work as a video presentation at the School of
Computing Virtual Symposium this fall. Student teams should submit their video files by December 6
(Friday). The submitted video files will be uploaded to the Symposium YouTube channel and made
viewable for the general public. CIS 4327 students will be expected to view other student video
presentations and submit their evaluations. The videos will be available on YouTube from December 7 to
9.
Video file due date: December 6, 2020
Symposium presentation viewing dates: December 7 to 9, 2020
Please note that if you do not submit the video file, view symposium presentations, and submit
evaluations, you will not receive any project presentation points. If you are not able to present the prepare
the video files and submit evaluation forms, you must reach out to the instructor to make alternate
arrangements during the first week of the semester.
Attendance and Class Participation
CIS 4327 Senior Project I will be held using remote instruction. Thus, class lectures and other activities
will be held via Canvas Zoom. It is important to attend the class regularly, participate, and contribute to
the class discussions. Class participation includes attendance, participation in class discussions, and
overall knowledge and interest in the course materials. Class participation grade would be linked to your
attendance and participation. While attendance may not necessarily be taken every day, both excessive
absences and attendance would be duly noted. In case of excessive absence (<50%), it will result in zero
grade for class participation. In the case of extreme absence (<25%), you may be given failing grade for
the entire course, as the extreme absence equals to not taking the course. If you miss a class, it is your
18
responsibility to obtain the material that is covered and other information provided in the class. Please
note that it is not possible to make up a missed class.
Senior project is a hands-on and project-oriented class. You and your team are expected to provide the
instructor with updates on project work during every class day. A considerable amount of the class time
will be allocated for project work and to conduct discussions with your team members. Attending the
class allows you to ask the instructor any questions that you or team may have. Thus, regular class
attendance and participation help not only you but also your team. Regular class attendance by all team
members increases the quality of the work produced by the team. Therefore, students are encouraged
to attend class regularly, actively participate in discussions, ask questions, and voice their opinions
respectfully.
Industry Mentor Feedback
As you are working with a client, you will quite often face problems that may be in the realm of client/real-
world issues and technical issues. You are expected to meet with your industry mentor regularly (at a
minimum twice a month) to discuss your issues and identify solutions. Please note that mentors are there
to direct you to possible solution sources. They are not there to provide you a solution directly. The onus
of learning about the problem, identify appropriate solutions, and incorporating those solutions is your
responsibility. Mentors will evaluate you on your critical thinking, professionalism, and technical issues.
For the fall semester, you are expected to conduct regular review sessions with your mentor. Please note
that mentors will evaluate you on an individual basis. Thus, it is essential that everyone in the team meet
with the mentor and communicates with a mentor regularly. See the below table as a guide on what
review sessions to conduct monthly.
Month Review Sessions to conduct with Mentor
September Interview questions, user story documentation, and technology
platform selections
October Use case documentations and experimental prototype development
November UML artifacts, preliminary database, user interface mockups, and
viable prototype
December Source code review and continuing development of viable prototype
during the break
Industry mentors will be providing feedback to the instructor on each student's contributions to the
project at the end of each month. Mentors will be using your communications, review sessions, and
contributions made to the project to evaluate you and provide feedback to the instructor. Mentors will
be using below given rubrics for assessing each student. For each criterion, the mentor will give a score
of 1 to 5, where 1 represents significantly below minimum expectations, and 5 represents substantially
exceeds expectations.

Service-Learning Reflective Essay (Individual Activity, Due: December 7)
In the senior project class, among many things that you are gaining knowledge and skills on processes
followed to develop an information system for a real client, project and team management aspects of
software development, web development technologies, tools used in a software development projects,
how to interact with a client, and deliver a quality working product. However, most importantly, through
the real-world project, you are also learning how to be a good information systems professional and how
to be an effective citizen.
Civic engagement is an important characteristic of being an effective citizen as it collectively improves
the quality of life in a community. Civic engagement or civic participation is about the general public (or
those who live in a community) coming together to work on issues that affect their community. Civic
engagement essentially means an individual collaborates with others in the community to make a
difference by contributing their knowledge and skills.
As a part of this class, you are analyzing and applying a variety of knowledge and skills to resolve an issue
for a nonprofit organization or a small-business organization. You are essentially providing a professional
service to an organization by developing and delivering an information system. Thus, through the senior
project class, you are engaging with the community as a civic-minded individual.
At the end of the semester, students are expected to write an essay on the strategies and skills needed
for becoming a successful information systems professional. In this essay, you are expected to reflect on
your experiences of working with a community partner. There is no specific length or formatting
requirements for this essay. Following guidelines should be used to write this reflective essay:
Service-Learning Reflection
• Discuss how your service-learning work impacts the community partner’s mission.
• Describe how you applied software development and general computing knowledge to help the
community partner.
21
• Discuss lessons learned in relevance to computing discipline, about you, and the Northeast Florida
region through service-learning activities.
• Describe how this service-learning work is helping you to become a better citizen.
• Describe how you will employ computing knowledge for the betterment of the Northeast Florida
region.
Information Systems Professional Reflection
• Discuss your personal career goals. Describe short-term and long-term goals.
• Based on your experiences, describe the positive and negative aspects of working with a community
partner. Describe how well you performed.
• Based on your experiences with interacting with the community partner and working on a real-world
project, identify the qualities or skills that you feel need to develop become a computing professional.
• Discuss your plan for professional development
• Describe any recommendations for improving this course that could help you achieve your
professional goals

Course Schedule
It is expected that the student will come prepared for the class meetings with questions for the instructor
on the course topics and project-related issues. The student is responsible for all topics presented
regardless of their coverage. Please note that below listing of chapters does not mean that all text in
those chapters would be covered in this course. Only materials relevant to the class would be covered.
Throughout the course, the instructor would provide other supplementary materials to provide targeted
guidance to team project deliverables.
The senior project class uses flipped classroom techniques to teach concepts and help students to use the
concepts by applying real-world projects. Video lectures will be available in Canvas for the predominant
of the course topics. The instructor will review the course topic and provide in-class activities in which
students will be expected to apply the concepts learned. Thus, students are expected to view video
lectures before the class period.

Other Remarks
Students with Disabilities
Students with disabilities who seek reasonable accommodations in the classroom or other aspects of
performing their coursework must first register with the UNF Disability Resource Center (DRC) located
in Building 57, Room 1500. DRC staff members work with students to obtain required documentation of
disability and to identify appropriate accommodations as required by applicable disability laws, including
the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). After receiving all necessary documentation, the DRC staff
determines whether a student qualifies for services with the DRC, and if so, the accommodations the
student requires will be provided. DRC staff then prepares a letter for the student to provide faculty
advising them of approved accommodations. For further information, contact the DRC by phone (904)
620-2769, email (drc@unf.edu), or visit the DRC website (http://www.unf.edu/drc/).
Military and veteran students who return from combat exposure may be utilizing the post 9/11 GI bill to
continue post-secondary education goals and may need both physical and academic accommodations.
Contact the Military and Veterans’ Resource Center by phone (904) 620-5131 or email mvrc@unf.edu.
